This app adds support for Sensative Strips in Homey.

Release notes
-------------
* In this initial version, Strips will be set to a simple binary sensor. I'd like to switch to using its default operating mode in the future, which may require the device to be re-added.
* The US version of Strips is not yet recognized. It may be added in a future version (testers needed).
